Code for MasterMind, a guessing game that utilized an efficient algorithm for Data Structures and Algorithms.

Initially, the player must give a number of different letters and positions that their combination can have for the computer 
to play against them and guess the final combination correctly. After each guess, the human then tells them how many colors
were in the right position, and how many colors were in the wrong position but correct to be used eventually anyway. Once the 
computer guesses the right combination, the game is complete.

The algorithm works by running through the list of possible positions and elminating false possible moves. The challenge was getting
this algorithm to work quickly with a large number of possibilities, and overall, the computer can guess most combinations within
ten moves.
