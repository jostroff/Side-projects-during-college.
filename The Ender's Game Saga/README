Ender's Game.

  Objective: 
      To get one of your players into the other person's goal, located in their color as a long line on the middle of their side's edge.
  Way it works:
      Players move and shoot and bump into each other.
        They can only move to increase their velocity. 
        They can only shoot horizontally, towards their opponent's side.
      If shot, the opponent player "freezes" and its number turns black and the player retains the velocity it had at the 
        time of getting shot.
      A player can only score if it is not frozen.
      There are four players on a person's side that can score one point and shoot, but they can only shoot if they are not frozen.
      The doctor, (represented by the letter "D") however, cannot shoot at all.
        It can instead "unfreeze" other players by bumping into them, allowing them to move/shoot/score as before.
        It scores two points if it goes into the goal.
      To note: You have more momentum on your own side. This is to give you leveraging power in case an opponent bumps into you.
      
      
  AI game controls: JIKL for movement, UO for switch, N for shoot.
  Two-player controls: 
      Player 1 (right): Arrow keys for movement, OI for switch, semicolon for shoot. 
      Player 2 (left): WASD for movement, XZ for switch, C for shoot.
  Other controls: 0 to reset the score to 0, and 9 to reset the current game to its initial position. 
  
  
  The "end game" is up to the people playing. 
  If they choose to go to 10 points, then they can reset the score to 0 afterwards. There is no set limit though.
