# Side-projects-during-college.
These are my side projects. 

These were written during high school and college.

Includes Ender's Game, other graphical games and tools written in Java.
Also includes an interactive online sketchboard MVC written in HTML/CSS, Javascript, and C# using the .NET framework.

Note: I published code for certain independent and academic projects here, but also one post-college project in the "Side-projects-after-college" folder on my github: https://github.com/jostroff/Side-Projects-After-College.

The code of the final project for my Web Development class, White Board, was posted into a zip folder, and code and screenshots for projects such as Ender's Game, an early college project, the Tic-Tac-Toe minimax algorithm for an Artificial Intelligence class, and MasterMind for Data Structures and Algorithms are all here.
