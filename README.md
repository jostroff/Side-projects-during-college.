# Side-projects-during-college.
These are my side projects. 

These were written during high school and college.

Includes Ender's Game, other graphical games and tools written in Java.
Also includes an interactive online sketchboard written in HTML/CSS, Javascript, and C# using the .NET framework.

Note: I published code for certain high school projects and college projects here, but also one post-college project in the "Side-projects-after-college" folder on my github: https://github.com/jostroff/Side-Projects-After-College.

The code for the final project for Web Development, White Board, was posted into a zip folder, and code for projects such as Ender's Game, a high school project, the Tic-Tac-Toe minimax algorithm for Artificial Intelligence, and MasterMind are all here.
