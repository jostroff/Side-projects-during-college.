These are my side projects. 
Includes Ender's Game, other graphical games and tools. Also an interactive online sketchboard.

For Ender's Game, 
  AI game controls: JIKL for movement, UO for switch, N for shoot, 0 to reset the score to 0, and 9 to reset the current game to its 
  initial position.
  Two-player controls: 
    Player 1: Arrow keys for movement, OI for switch, semicolon for shoot.
    Player 2: WASD for movement, XZ for switch, C for shoot.
